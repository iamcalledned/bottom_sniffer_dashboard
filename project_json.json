Create a modular, extensible dashboard named "Bottom Sniffer Dashboard" for monitoring financial markets. The dashboard should be configured using JSON and support the following features:

The dashboard will be on a server that has a local IP of 192.168.86.52 and external IP of 96.230.202.72

user uses apache for web server and is good with python.  does not like streamlit

will need to make sure apache is configured properly to point to iamcalledned.ai and the new homepage

website is secure with certbot

user IP home address is iamcalledned.ai

user will need a fun and inviting home page that will link into the market sniffing dashboard we create


Organize data into clearly defined categories with lists of indicators under each.

Each indicator should support:

Real-time data feed (e.g., FRED, Yahoo Finance, or market APIs).

Threshold-based alert system (color-coded: green/yellow/red).

Optionally support delta tracking (daily/weekly change).

Include a composite scoring system to reflect overall market stress called "Sniff Score" (range 0–100).
